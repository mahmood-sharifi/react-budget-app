# React Budget App

This repository contains a React application to manage incomes, expenses, and saving targets. The application is built using TypeScript and focuses on fundamental concepts.

## Level 1: Basic Requirements

Apply TypeScript to complete this assignment. The application includes the following features:

- Create UI for a one-page application to store incomes, expenses, and saving targets, saving amount
- Implement features to add income sources, value and date.
- Implement features to add expense sources, value, and date.
- Implement features to add the value of the target saving.
- Implement features to add the value of the saving amount.
- Display a summary section showing total income, total expenses, target saving amount, and current saving amount.
- Use CSS modules or styled-components or anything you prefer to style the application components.
- Depoly the app on netlify or vercel or anywhere you prefer and then add the link to the PR.

## Level 2: Additional Requirements

In addition to the basic requirements, the application enhances its functionality with the following features:

- Calculate the account balance using the formula: income - expense - saving = balance.
- Implement a feature to transfer the balance amount to the saving amount.
- Calculate the total of the current saving and the percentage of the current saving amount / target of saving.
- Add a delete button to remove items in income and expense sources.
- Validate the input income, expense, target of income, and saving account. They should be positive numbers. In case the user enters a negative number, display an error message. Use React Hook Form and Zod to apply validation.
- Implement local storage to persist data so that it remains available even after a page refresh.

## Level 3: Bonus Requirements

If you have a higher skill level and finish the previous requirements before the deadline, you can tackle the following bonus tasks:

- Apply React Router so when users access "/budget-app", it will render the Budget component.
- Implement a chart to visualize the incomes and expenses using a library like react-chartjs-2 or recharts.
- Add a feature to export the income and expense data to a CSV file.

### Happy coding

### Deadline: 26th of June 9 a.m.
